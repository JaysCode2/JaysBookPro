# JaysBookPro
This project is used to practice my speed of coding about Book Manager System.
In layman's terms, I am just practicing some CRUD in this project, and then I will practice some technologies such as thread pool,
redisson to implement distributed locks, etc. You can understand it as a warehouse for my personal testing code and technology.
I also added some reusable configuration and tool classes, such as data return class, file upload and download interface,
redisson configuration, knife4j settings, etc.
